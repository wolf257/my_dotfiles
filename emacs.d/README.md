# My emacs config files

This is my emacs config files, initially forked from :

```
https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d
```

(Thank you Steve !!!)

## Supported Emacs versions

Emacs 24.3 or greater

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el` :

```
git clone https://github.com/wolf257/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

If you plan to customize things more extensively, just fork the repo and hack it away !

(All my customizations are in `lisp/init-0-*.el` and `custom.el`)
